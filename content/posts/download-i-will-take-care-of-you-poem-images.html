                I sleep on sheets covered in beer and carry boxes of bottles to the trash room, boxes and sheets and smells that could get me in trouble with the people who wear uniforms and i put my head on the shoulder beside me and everything is sweat and stale alcohol and three am and i was. I know you&#039;ve been hurt by someone else i can tell by the way you carry yourself. Seize my words and listen well, then forever i will tell.
    </p>

    <h3>I am afraid i have, madam, says jones:</h3>
    <p>When all the years have come and gone and laid you low you should know when you think you&#039;re left out on your own i will be there i never gave you fancy clothes no diamond rings or the finer things but when you feel all alone don&#039;t you despair i will take care of you oh yes i will i. We won&#039;t go to the zoo tomorrow. I sleep on sheets covered in beer and carry boxes of bottles to the trash room, boxes and sheets and smells that could get me in trouble with the people who wear uniforms and i put my head on the shoulder beside me and everything is sweat and stale alcohol and three am and i was. Grandma always told me, that god takes care of babies, and fools.</p>
