    <p><strong>28+ I Lost My Brother Poems Images</strong>. Siblings that pass away have special meaning to us. What you mean to me i cannot express, you&#039;re more than someone i call when i am in distress.</p>

                Who will be our brother unknown? Because just 10 months later, another brother gained his wings. He is fighting for his life tonight and it is a horrible sight to see him like this and think that he might be gone and i would miss another a minute with him.
    </p>

    <h3>I wrote this to him as i didnt get to go to his funeral.</h3>
    <p>A couple of months ago my search finally came to an end, my long lost brother is now my good friend. My little brother is strong we saw he was all along. My brother is learning english now. This time i choose a topic—love—less grim if equally compelling.</p>
