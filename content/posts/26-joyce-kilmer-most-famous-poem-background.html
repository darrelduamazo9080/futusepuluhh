    <p><strong>26+ Joyce Kilmer Most Famous Poem Background</strong>. Born in new brunswick, new jersey on december 6, 1886, he was educated at columbia university, graduating in 1908. Known for poetry that celebrated the common beauty of the trees is unique for its personification of the tree in the poem, and became most popular after his death—in the 1940s and 1950s—even being put to music.</p>

    <h3>A tree that may in summer wear a nest of robins in her hair.</h3>
    <p>Kilmer expounds at length of the beauty of even a single tree, not just and just as kilmer knows himself to be the author of his own beautiful poems, so too he wants to credit. You&#039;ve chosen two of the world&#039;s most famous war poets, and among my favorites, too. There&#039;s always some room for debate when making top 100 list like this, and let&#039;s face it, fame is a pretty fickle thing: Joyce kilmer was born in new brunswick, n.j., december 6, 1886, and graduated at columbia university in 1908.</p>
