                Do you want to state it plainly or do you want the reader to become absorbed in the poem? Try starting your poem further down. For example, american poet emily dickinson described inner feelings when she wrote her lyric poem that begins, i felt a funeral, in my brain, / and mourners to and fro..
    </p>

    <h3>I often hear from my online students how relieving it is to bring structure and tools into the mix as we delve into lyric writing.</h3>
    <p>Then i look under the hood to see how it was put together, to extract tools that i can pass on to my students. Write these down on a piece of paper that is separate from the one you have your original source poems on. Have fun writing lyrics and experimenting with different musical styles. Try starting your poem further down.</p>
